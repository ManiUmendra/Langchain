LangChain allows you to create sequences of actions, like calling a language model (LLM), using a tool, or processing data. These sequences are called "chains." There are two main ways to use chains in LangChain:

Chains Built with LCEL: LCEL (LangChain Execution Language) is the main way to build chains in LangChain. It allows you to connect different steps in a flexible way. Even though LCEL can seem complex, LangChain provides easier methods to create these chains. Underneath, though, it's still using LCEL to manage everything.

Legacy Chains: These are older types of chains that were built using a different method, not LCEL. They are standalone and don't use LCEL's features.



how to add cpu and gpu in langchain 
ChatGPT
To add CPU and GPU resources in LangChain, which is a framework for building language model applications, you typically don't directly manage the hardware resources (CPU/GPU) in LangChain itself. Instead, LangChain interfaces with language models, which can be deployed on hardware that supports CPU or GPU acceleration.

Here's a general approach to set up and use CPU/GPU with LangChain:

1. Setting Up the Environment
Install LangChain:

bash
Copy code
pip install langchain
Install PyTorch:
For CPU:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch
For GPU (with CUDA):

bash
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
Install Transformers (if using Hugging Face models):

bash
Copy code
pip install transformers
2. Loading Models with CPU/GPU Support
When loading models in LangChain, you can specify whether to use CPU or GPU by setting the appropriate device. For instance, using Hugging Face's transformers library:

python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline

# For CPU
device = -1

# For GPU
device = 0

# Load a pre-trained model
model = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2', device=device)
3. Integrating with LangChain
Once you have the model set up with the desired device (CPU/GPU), you can integrate it with LangChain. Here's a basic example:

python
Copy code
from langchain.llms import HuggingFaceLLM
from langchain import Chain

# Assuming 'model' is the loaded pipeline from above
llm = HuggingFaceLLM(model=model)

# Define your chain using the LLM
chain = Chain(llms=[llm])

# Use the chain for text generation or other tasks
response = chain.run("Tell me a joke")
print(response)
4. Utilizing GPUs Efficiently
Ensure that your environment is properly set up to utilize GPUs. For example:

CUDA and cuDNN: Ensure you have the correct versions of CUDA and cuDNN installed.
NVIDIA Drivers: Ensure the latest NVIDIA drivers are installed for your GPU.
Example: Full Script
Here's a complete example script:

python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline
from langchain.llms import HuggingFaceLLM
from langchain import Chain

# Set device: -1 for CPU, 0 for GPU
device = 0  # Change to -1 for CPU

# Load the model with the specified device
model = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2', device=device)

# Integrate with LangChain
llm = HuggingFaceLLM(model=model)
chain = Chain(llms=[llm])

# Generate text
response = chain.run("Tell me a joke")
print(response)
Additional Considerations
Memory Management: Ensure you have enough memory (RAM/VRAM) to handle the models.
Batch Processing: For large-scale tasks, consider batch processing to efficiently utilize GPU resources.
Environment Configuration: Use tools like nvidia-smi to monitor GPU usage and configure your environment accordingly.
By following these steps, you can effectively utilize CPU or GPU resources with LangChain for various NLP tasks.

Chains refer to sequences of calls - whether to an LLM, a tool, or a data preprocessing step. The primary supported way to do this is with LCEL.

LCEL is great for constructing your chains, but it's also nice to have chains used off the shelf. There are two types of off-the-shelf chains that LangChain supports:

Chains that are built with LCEL. In this case, LangChain offers a higher-level constructor method. However, all that is being done under the hood is constructing a chain with LCEL.
[Legacy] Chains constructed by subclassing from a legacy Chain class. These chains do not use LCEL under the hood but are the standalone classes.
We are working on creating methods that create LCEL versions of all chains. We are doing this for a few reasons.

Chains constructed in this way are nice because if you want to modify the internals of a chain you can simply modify the LCEL.
These chains natively support streaming, async, and batch out of the box.
These chains automatically get observability at each step.

Legacy Chains: These are older types of chains that were built using a different method, not LCEL. They are standalone and don't use LCEL's features.

LangChain is moving towards using LCEL for all chains because it offers several advantages:

Easy to Modify: If you want to change how a chain works, you can easily adjust the LCEL code.
Advanced Features: Chains built with LCEL can automatically handle tasks like streaming data, running asynchronously, or processing batches of data.
Better Visibility: LCEL chains allow you to track what's happening at each step, making it easier to understand and debug the chain.
In simple terms, LCEL is the preferred way to create and manage sequences of tasks in LangChain because it offers flexibility, advanced features, and better control.

LangChain Expression Language, or LCEL, is a declarative way to easily compose chains together. LCEL was designed from day 1 to support putting prototypes in production, with no code changes, from the simplest “prompt + LLM” chain to the most complex chains (we’ve seen folks successfully run LCEL chains with 100s of steps in production). To highlight a few of the reasons you might want to use LCEL:

First-class streaming support When you build your chains with LCEL you get the best possible time-to-first-token (time elapsed until the first chunk of output comes out). For some chains this means eg. we stream tokens straight from an LLM to a streaming output parser, and you get back parsed, incremental chunks of output at the same rate as the LLM provider outputs the raw tokens.

Async support Any chain built with LCEL can be called both with the synchronous API (eg. in your Jupyter notebook while prototyping) as well as with the asynchronous API (eg. in a LangServe server). This enables using the same code for prototypes and in production, with great performance, and the ability to handle many concurrent requests in the same server.

LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is a powerful tool that makes it easier to create and manage chains in LangChain. These chains can range from simple tasks, like using a language model to generate text, to complex workflows involving many steps. LCEL is designed to help you move from experimenting with your ideas to putting them into production without needing to rewrite your code.

Here’s why LCEL is useful:

Streaming Support: LCEL is optimized to give you the quickest response possible. When you use it to build chains, it allows you to start receiving and processing the output from a language model as soon as it's generated. This means you can see the results faster, which is especially helpful in real-time applications.

Async Support: LCEL chains can run both synchronously (waiting for each step to finish before moving on) and asynchronously (running multiple steps at the same time). This flexibility is great because you can use the same code for testing in a notebook and in a high-performance production environment. The async support also means you can handle many requests simultaneously, making your system more efficient.
